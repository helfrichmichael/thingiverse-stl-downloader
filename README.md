# Thingiverse STL Downloader

Those ads sure are annoying. Skip 'em, and get straight to the good stuff.

> This repository is here for the normal purposes of version control, but also to allow users to side-load the extension just in-case Google doesn't approve it.

## Install

The extension can (hopefully) be installed from the web store, or from source.

### Install from Web Store

If/when the extension is approved by Google, I'll replace this sentence with a link to the web store page.

### Install from Source

1. Download the [latest release](https://github.com/stephancasas/thingiverse-stl-downloader/releases/tag/latest).
2. Unzip the contents somewhere on your disk.

   - I created a folder in `Documents` called _Custom Chrome Extensions_

3. In Chrome, go to `chrome://extensions` in the address bar.
4. Turn on the _Developer Mode_ option in the upper-right corner.
5. Choose _Load Unpacked_
6. Browse to and select the directory where you unzipped the extension release.
7. Enable the extension.
8. Enjoy, and keep on making stuff.
